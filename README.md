# Technical-Coding-Questions
A collection of my solutions to various technical coding questions found on the internet. This repository was originally created to easily share my solutions with friends and collegues. 

Feel free to clone/fork this repository if the solutions are helpful with your technical interview preparation.

## Repository Contents
Solutions were organised into separate folders for categorisation purposes:
- ```ama-oa2-i``` contains solutions to problems for AWS intern positions.
- ```ama-oa2-ng``` contains solutions to problems for AWS new grad positions.
- ```ama-os``` contains solutions to problems for AWS onsites.
- ```mic-oa``` contains solutions to problems for Microsoft onsites.
- ```random-exercises``` contains solutions to... random exercises I found.

## Notes
-  These technical coding questions were primarily sourced from technical interview preparation websites and blogs (Leetcode, Hackerrank, etc.).
-  My solutions are written in Java.
-  Each solution is written in their own class, complete with problem description and complexity analysis.
-  My solutions may not be the most optimal solution possible.
-  Time and space complexity analyses were deduced using my own judgement and understanding. Therefore, I recommend double checking my complexity analyses when reviewing these solutions to see if I am correct.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Install Java SDK
3. Open in VSCode
4. Open the App.java file
